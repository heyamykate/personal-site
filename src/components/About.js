					<h3>I started coding with MySpace, and Iâ€™ve come a long way since table based layouts and Fall Out Boy profile songs. I believe in artisanship, accountability, and a healthy sense of humor. Collaborating with other people - engineer or otherwise - to craft an elegant solution is my workplace Nirvana. </h3>
